- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BadzWolf
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m here because I'd like to report a 100% reprodicuble Lutris bug which, in my day, would have been considered a showstopper, and this is apparently the *preferred* way to report it.
- <sigh/>
I have a workaround, so I guess I don't really care that much, but I'll spend an hour or so figuring out how to do that.
